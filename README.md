# CS Coursework Projects

These projects were developed as part of my Computer Science coursework at Kennesaw State University.

They demonstrate:
- Problem-solving and logical thinking
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modular design
- Basic object-oriented programming
- Input validation and error handling

## Selected Projects

- **OwlBanking System** – Console-based banking simulation with deposits, withdrawals, and transaction history  
- **Treasure Hunt Game** – Grid-based game using 2D lists and randomness  
- **Rent-A-Car System** – Object-oriented program modeling cars, rentals, and returns  

More projects may be added as coursework progresses.
